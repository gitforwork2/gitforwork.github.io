description: H1b amendment is needed when 
---

H4 EAD applications are being processed in many centers in H1b amendment

###
I have visa stamping till 2017. I got this stamped when I wa working for Client A. I then changed client and the location few months back. Employer filed LCA and I Joined the new client and did not do the amendment. It is mandatory to file H1B Amendement from now?

I understand MSA is not same state .. It is Metro Statistical Area. :-) All I am saying is if you manage to get a job within your MSA ( e.g. NYC area, Houston area, Atlanta area or within your commutable distance and the wages are not that off to your LCA wages) at least you don't need to file an amendment. This is some relief. Isn't it?

###
MSAs can transcend state boundaries. The tristate area you are talking about is a perfect example. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropoli... The link above lists the counties in NJ and in NY (And even one in PA) that falls under the MSA for NYC.

###
You are over complicating things I believe. A move within the same MSA (same client or otherwise), assuming there aren't any 'other' material changes like job duties, roles and responsibilities does not warrant an amendment. An LCA is needed and has to be posted (even if one already exists for that location).
