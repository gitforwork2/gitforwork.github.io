## What is a H1b amendment and who is responsible for it?

When a H1b employee's job with the same employer undergoes changes like location, role, responsibility etc his/her H1b should be amended to reflect those changes. It's the responsibility of the employer to pay and file for the amendment.

## I am on H1b visa and my work location is changing, Is it mandatory to file H1b amendment?
It depends. If your new work location falls under the same Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) then you won't need to do an amendment. But if they are different then you would need one. 

## What is a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)?
A Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_statistical_area] is a geographical region defined by population and economic activities. MSAs are designated as such by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), a federal govt agency.

## I am with the same Employer and same client, but work location at client is changing. Do I need to file an amendment?
If the move is permanent and the new location is in a different MSA, then you would need to file an amendment. If the move is temporary,
depending on certain criteria, you won't need an amendment.

## I am with the same employer, but joining a new client in the same area. Do I need to file an amendment?
If the location is within the same MSA and there is no change in roles, responsibilites etc, you won't need one.

## Are MSAs confined to a state?
No. MSAs are not bound by state, city boundries they can transcend them. For example, certain areas in New York and New Jersey states fall under the same MSA. The tristate area you are talking about is a perfect example. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropoli... The link above lists the counties in NJ and in NY (And even one in PA) that falls under the MSA for NYC.

You are over complicating things I believe. A move within the same MSA (same client or otherwise), assuming there aren't any 'other' material changes like job duties, roles and responsibilities does not warrant an amendment. An LCA is needed and has to be posted (even if one already exists for that location).

I heard this has to be done before you start working at new client, is this true?

Does anyone know how much time is it taking for h1 amendment approval under normal process? It's been 4 months since my employer filed my h1 amendment no updates yet. I'm planning to convert it into PP, IS it gud idea to do so? Plz share your experience.
