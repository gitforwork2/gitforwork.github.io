Alien registration number is a unique number assigned by USCIS to permanent immigrants of the U.S. Alien registration number is a 7-9 
characters long and also commonly referred as "A-number" (A#). Typically, USCIS assigns a A-number for immigrants applying for permanent 
residency or green card. The alien registration number is unique to an individual and doesn't change once assigned. Hence, it's almost like the social 
security number of immigration. USCIS stores all the immigration documents identified by the A-number and the same can be obtained by filing 
a USCIS FOIA through the A-number.

Your A# is a personal identifier assigned by the USCIS if you apply for an adjustment of status, for employment authorization, 
for a V visa and in certain other cases. The agency uses it to verify your identity in its internal processing systems. 
It is not used to identify individual petitions or filings.

H1b visa is a non-immigrant visa, hence a H1b applicant doesn't typically have a alien registration number. However, USCIS assigns an
alien registration number when the H1b recipient's I-140 is approved for green card. A# is typically printed on any H1b approvals notices
(Form I-797) subsequent to the I140 approval.
