Alien registration number is an unique 7-9 digit unique number assigned by USCIS to permanent immigrants of the U.S. Alien registration number is also commonly referred to as "A-number" (A#) or USCIS number. 

Example A-numbers look like, 
0X0-0X0-0X0

Typically, USCIS assigns a A-number for immigrants applying for permanent residency or green card. It is also assigned in other situations like at the time of applying for employment authorization document (EAD). The alien registration number is unique to an individual and assigned A# is carried all throughout the lifetime and beyond of the immigrant. Hence, it's almost like a social security number for immigration. USCIS archives all the immigration documents identified by the A-number and the same can be obtained by filing a USCIS FOIA through the A-number. 

## How do I find my alien registration number?

There are a few ways to get your alien registration number. 

### EAD 
If you have a Employment Authorization Document (EAD), your A-number would be printed on the card. It may be called USCIS # on the card.
Typically, for students who are on F1 visa and who have obtained OPT work permit, this is a easy way to get to the alien registration number.

### I797 Approval documents

In many cases USCIS prints the A# on the I797 approval notices. For example, USCIS assigns a A# for an immigrant whose form I140 is approved for employment based permanent residency. Such immigrant's H1b application I797 approval notices contain their A-number.

### USCIS Infopass appointment

If you are not able to find your A# in your existing immigration documents, you can get it directly from USCIS through their [infopass appointment](https://my.uscis.gov/appointment). Since the alien registration number is personal and confidential information, USCIS does not share it over phone. So schedule an infopass appointment and be prepared to present your ID proof. Upon verification, USCIS will give your alie registration number.

## Alien registration number H1b

H1b visa is a non-immigrant visa, hence a H1b applicant doesn't typically have a alien registration number. However, USCIS assigns an
alien registration number when the H1b recipient's I-140 is approved for green card. A# is typically printed on any H1b approvals notices (Form I-797) subsequent to the I140 approval. 

## Alien registration number F1 visa

F1 visa, like the H1b is not a permanent residency visa. Hence, there are no alien registration number assigned to a student. However,
a A# is assigned when the student applies for OPT EAD. The number is printed on the EAD card.

## Does alien registration number appear in I-94?
No I-94 is not printed on the I-94. Not all immigrants have a A#. And even for the ones that have one, it's not printed on the I-94.
