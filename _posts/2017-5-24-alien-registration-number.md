description: Alien registration number 
---

Alien registration number is a unique number assigned by USCIS to permanent immigrants of the U.S. Alien registration number is a 7-9 
digit number and also commonly referred as "A-number" (A#) or USCIS number. Typically, USCIS assigns a A-number for immigrants applying for permanent residency or green card. It is also assigned in some other situations like at the time of applying for employment authorization document (EAD). The alien registration number is unique to an individual and doesn't change once assigned. Hence, it's almost like the social security number of immigration. USCIS stores all the immigration documents identified by the A-number and the same can be obtained by filing a USCIS FOIA through the A-number.

It is also assigned if you apply for an employment authorization document (such as an F-1 OPT), a V visa, find yourself in deportation proceedings, and in a number of other situations.

## Alien registration number H1b

H1b visa is a non-immigrant visa, hence a H1b applicant doesn't typically have a alien registration number. However, USCIS assigns an
alien registration number when the H1b recipient's I-140 is approved for green card. A# is typically printed on any H1b approvals notices (Form I-797) subsequent to the I140 approval. 

## Alien registration number F1 visa

F1 visa, like the H1b is not a permanent residency visa. Hence, there are no alien registration number assigned to a student. However,
a A# is assigned when the student applies for OPT EAD. The number is printed on the EAD card.

## Does alien registration number appear in I-94?
No I-94 is not printed on the I-94. Not all immigrants have a A#. And even for the ones that have one, it's not printed on the I-94.
